# MetalOxideSolubility
## Exercise in Data Science to predict solubility of Metal Oxides

This exercise was generated using Google Gemini to practice on a simple yet important Chemistry problem. I have asked Gemini to generate 100 data points. Such data points have been exported in a CSV file and are present in the repository for use. Asking Gemini to generate data is by the way an example of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) for the purpose of data analysis.
